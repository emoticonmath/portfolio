                        Greetings, my name is Mahir Yasar. My career goal is to become a computer science engineer.
                        My ultimate goal is to work at a company such as Google, Facebook, or Apple writing or modifying software.
                        I am a sophomore at Dublin High School, and to I am currently taking courses such as Honors Principles of Engineering, Honors Chemistry, and Trigonometry/Pre-Calculus.
                        I plan to take future computer science courses throughout the duration of my high school career, as well as pursuing them into university, in which I plan to major in
                        computer software design.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ever since I was a child, I was always fascinated by the prospects of computers and their abilites of completing tasks due to the writings of various programs and algorithms
                        that improve daily life. As a seven-year-old, I was much more captivated by video games, how they were programmed, how they were designed, and the algorithms written by developers
                        for the sake of variables such as random encounters or the actions of NPCs, (non-playable characters) and so on and so forth. However, as I got older, my interest in game development
                        and game design began to grow into a more general interest for computer software in general. I wondered how webpages were written, how they were styled with so many layers, and how the
                        sites had interaction with the user, and how that interaction created new scenearios based on the user input. Needless to say, I was fueled with interest for computer science, and as I grew older,
                        I began to learn more about this processes, learning programming languages like HTML, CSS, and Python.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My personal strengths consist of my ability to learn new concepts quickly and easily, coinciding with my ability to process information critically on the spot attentatively, as well as being able to
                        work well with others, both in leadership positions and as a contributing member of a group. Another notable quality of mine is being able to well articulate points and arguments coherently.
                        The former quality is displayed in my ability to write websites and functions, that, while having no actual purpose unto themselves,
                        demonstrated knowledge of the aforementioned skills, as one such website was a video game guide website for various games, for the expressed purpose of helping those stuck on a certain puzzle of the game find the answer.
                        An example of my ability to work with others is being able to help with crucial aspects of designing and building for certain projects, and assisting other group members in other group projects.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My accomplishments mostly consist of either skills or not pertaining necessarily to my career goals. I am proficient in computer languages such as HTML, CSS, and Python, and am well versed in
                        Google Suite and Microsoft Office, as well as having worked in programs like Unity and Unreal Engine 4.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While I am only a tenth grader, I have learned that I am able to adapt to my environment well, learn quickly and efficiently, and will continue to develop my skills and grow as a result of these
                        strengths.
